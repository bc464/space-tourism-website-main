### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### Continued development

This project was a follow along video presented by Kevin Powell. The Technology page was left to the viewer to finalize. With my current knowledge base i do not know how to change the images on the "Technology" page as they differ from the desktop view in smaller screens. Something more to learn in my HTML, CSS and JavaScript growth path.
